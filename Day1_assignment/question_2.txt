Difference between var, let, and const:

1)var:
var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped.

The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.

var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function.
ex:
var a=10,//globally scoped
function newFun(){
    var hello="hi";//function scoped
}

var variables can be re-declared and updated
This means that we can do this within the same scope and won't get an error.

    var greeter = "hey hi";
    var greeter = "say Hello instead";

2)Let:
A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly braces is a block.

So a variable declared in a block with let  is only available for use within that block.
ex:
let greet="hi";
{
    let hello="hello everyone";
}
console.log(greet);//prints hi to console
console.log(hello);//hello is not defined

*)Just like var,  a variable declared with let can be updated within its scope. Unlike var, a let variable cannot be re-declared within its scope. So while this will work:

    let greeting = "say Hi";
    greeting = "say Hello instead";
this will return an error:

    let greeting = "say Hi";
    let greeting = "say Hello instead"; // error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared
Just like var,  a variable declared with let can be updated within its scope. Unlike var, a let variable cannot be re-declared within its scope. So while this will work:

    let greeting = "say Hi";
    greeting = "say Hello instead";
this will return an error:

    let greeting = "say Hi";
    let greeting = "say Hello instead"; // error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared

3)const:
Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.
const declarations are block scoped
Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared.

const cannot be updated or re-declared
This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared. 
ex:
const greeting = "say Hi";
    greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Assignment to constant variable.
