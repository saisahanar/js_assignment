Available data types in JS:

JavaScript variables can hold many data types: numbers, strings, objects and more:
ex:
var length=12;//Number datatype
var name="Joe";//String datatype
var x= {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"}; //objects

1)JavaScript Strings:

A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".

Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:
Example
var carName1 = "Volvo XC60";   // Using double quotes
var carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';   // Using single quotes

2)JavaScript Numbers:
JavaScript has only one type of numbers.

Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:

Example
var x1 = 34.00;     // Written with decimals
var x2 = 34;        // Written without decimals
Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponential) notation:

Example
var y = 123e5;      // 12300000
var z = 123e-5;     // 0.00123

3)JavaScript Booleans:
Booleans can only have two values: true or false.

Example
var x = 5;
var y = 5;
var z = 6;
(x == y)       // Returns true
(x == z)       // Returns false
Booleans are often used in conditional testing.

4)JavaScript Arrays:
JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.

Array items are separated by commas.

The following code declares (creates) an array called cars, containing three items (car names):

Example
var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], second is [1], and so on.

5)JavaScript Objects:
JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.

Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.

Example
var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
The object (person) in the example above has 4 properties: firstName, lastName, age, and eyeColor.
